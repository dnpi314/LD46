Keep Bubby Alive
	Bubby is relly stupid but cute, must keep it alive while it navigates a maze of traps
	Player must frantically platform and solve puzzles
	The game is over if either the player or Bubby dies

	Types of traps:
		Spike pits
		Crushing walls
		
To do Friday:

	Script Bubby's movement
	Make Bubby's art
